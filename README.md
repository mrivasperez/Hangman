## About
Everybody loves to play hangman when they are bored! I created an online version of the game written in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS (ES6). I had a lot of fun making this and hope you have a lot of fun playing it and making it your own. Stay tuned for a Medium post on how to make it for yourself as well as reasons I believe that writing this game is the best way to master basic JS concepts.
